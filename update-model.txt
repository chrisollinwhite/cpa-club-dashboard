Find this line in server/models/index.js (around line 90):

  getAll: () => {
    const stmt = db.prepare('SELECT id, email, name, status, is_admin, created_at, last_login FROM members ORDER BY created_at DESC');

CHANGE TO:

  getAll: () => {
    const stmt = db.prepare('SELECT id, email, name, status, is_admin, created_at, last_login, referral_link FROM members ORDER BY created_at DESC');

---

Also find this line (around line 75):

  findByEmail: (email) => {
    const stmt = db.prepare('SELECT * FROM members WHERE email = ?');

This one is already correct (SELECT * gets all columns including referral_link)
